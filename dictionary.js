        "en": "An experienced tester with passion for quality. Undertook lots of non-trivial tasks and enthusiastically accepted difficult cases. Executed inexecutable, worked with documentation, would always learn something new. Made routine automatic and implied complex tools into working process. Very uplifting and talkative. Don't like Friday releases, a lack of flexibility, implementation of outdated tools and when people say “it’s always been that way” instead of presenting clear and considered arguments."
